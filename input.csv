General Band Information,,,
Can anybody join the band? What are auditions for?,"Any student eligible to attend Lafayette High School can join the band! Band is an elective class available to all students, though prior experience playing a band instrument is recommended. Any student who enrolls in band class is automatically a member of the marching band, and participation in the marching band is a component of all band classes. Students who play a school-sponsored Fall sport can request an exemption from this requirement.
There are three concert bands at LHS (Wind Symphony, Symphonic Band, and Concert Band) that meet during the school day as individual classes. An audition process occurs each spring to place students (for the following Fall) in the concert band most appropriate to their skill and experience level. Members of all three concert bands come together in the marching band.
Additionally, students in 8th grade who are districted to attend Lafayette HS can join the band as an extracurricular activity.",,
What are/Who are drum majors? ... Section leaders? How are they selected?,"Drum majors are the conductors of the marching band, and serve as performance and musical leaders for the entire band. Section leaders are experienced band members selected to lead the individual sections of the band. Each year there are 3-4 drum majors selected from the whole band and 1-4 section leaders for each section.
Selection as either a drum major or section leader is a significant honor, as selection is competitive based on auditions and interviews. Drum major training, auditions, and interviews are open to any interested band member and occur in the spring. The band directors select drum majors for the following year. Further interviews (open to any interested band member) are used by the band directors and drum majors to select section leaders.",,
What is the Color Guard? Are they part of the band? Where can I get more info?,"The Color Guard is a non-instrumental section of the marching band that performs on the field as part of the band. Traditionally they perform with flags, rifles, and sabers, and perform dance- and acrobatics-based moves. The Color Guard is a critical part of the band, and is open to any interested student in MS or HS. During the non-marching season, the Color Guard competes in ""Winter Guard"" competitions. Instrumentalists enrolled in band class can join the Color Guard instead of marching with their instrument, but you do not have to be in band class or play an instrument to join the Color Guard! Ms. Emily Banks is *TITLE HERE*, and *NAME* and *NAME* are the Color Guard student captains for 2023-2024.",Color Guard do not have to play an instrument or be in band class. ,
"What is the Drum Line? ... the ""pit""? Where can I get more info?","The percussion section plays both marching instruments (snares, quints, bass drums) and non-marching instruments that are usually located on the front sideline (marimbas, xylophones, chimes, cymbals, timpani, synthesizers, drum kits, etc.). The ""drum line"" is the set of band members who play marching instruments, while the ""pit"" or ""front ensemble"" is the set of band members who play non-marching instruments. At times, non-percussion non-marching instrumentalists (guitars, oboes, etc.) perform as part of the pit/front ensemble. While all percussion players in the band are members of the percussion section and perform with the marching band, selection to the drum line specifically is highly competitive.",Some people refer to pit as front ensemble,
"What are the Wind Symphony, Symphonic Band, Concert Band, Jazz Band, and Jazz Ensemble?","Students enrolled in band class are placed into one of three different concert bands, which meet during the school day as three different classes. Students with the most experience and technical skill are placed in the Wind Symphony, while most beginning students are placed in the Concert Band.
Jazz Band and Jazz Ensemble are additional elective classes for students interested in Jazz performance. The most experienced and skilled students are placed into Jazz Ensemble.
Every student who enrolls in band class (Jazz band class) is guaranteed placement into one of the three bands (Jazz Band or Jazz Ensemble). Auditions for placement into these groups occur in the Spring, and all middle school band directors are provided detailed information on how students at their schools (if attending LHS) can audition.",,
How do you get into the [insert band/ensemble]?),Ensemble placement is decided by auditions that occur during the spring before the next school year begins. Students are assigned to a band/ensemble based on skill level and experience by the band directors.,You choose to schedule an ensemble class when you make you class schedule,
Who are the band staff and what do they do?,Robert Dee Bishop is the Director of Bands and Dr. Chris Strange and Mr. Aaron Jones are the Associate Directors. Emily Banks is in charge of the Color Guard.  There are other band staff that assist with marching and sectional instruction throughout the year.,,
What are the sections in the band?,"Sections are groups of players with common/similar instruments. The Lafayette Band sections are: Flutes, Clarinets, Low Reeds, Alto Sax, Trumpets, Mellophones, Trombones+Baritones, Tubas, Percussion, and Color Guard. Each section has one or more section leaders. During marching season, these groups will both have full band and section specific rehearsals (sectionals, which are usually one evening a week). During the winter concert season, sections perform as ""chamber"" groups which meet weekly in the evening.",,
Where does the marching show music come from?,"The directors choose selections from a wide range of musical literature to use as source music. This is sent to professional band composers to combine into a unique musical setting. The marching forms, also called drill, (the patterns and shapes formed by the band, and the paths by which individual band members move to form these shapes) are also created by professionals to match and augment the full musical setting. The LBA provides funds each year to cover the costs of this work. While it is possible to use music and marching composed for other bands in previous years, top bands, including the Lafayette Marching Band, commision new and unique music and marching tailored to their available instruments and marchers every year.",,
"What is a ""movement"" in the marching show?","The full marching show is about 10 minutes long (see questions in ""Band Performances/Competitions for details on rules/judging, incluing details of timing), and generally consists of ~3 identifiable sections. Often the show is learned section-by-section, but otherwise these ""movements"" are just like movements in an orchestral work--parts of the whole.",,
What are sets/props? Who designs them? Who builds/transports them?,"To contribute to the overall effect of the band's performance, set pieces and or props are used on the field. Sets and props are pieces of scenery or accessories just like would be used in a play or musical on stage, and may be things that move, are climbed on, or are carried by band members. Generally, set and prop design is completed by the show designer (see ""Where does the marching show music come from?""), and are entirely built by our Field Crew. Sets and props are loaded onto, driven by, unloaded by, and brought onto the field by the Field Crew as well! We're always looking for more Field Crew members, so if you'd like to help build or transport sets and props, or to have a chance to be on the sideline down on the field while the students perform, email **FIELD CREW CHIEF**!",,
What are new marchers? ... 8th-grade marchers?,"New marchers are any students who are in their first year with the marching band.  This could include any student in any grade who is new to band. Often these students are freshman at LHS, but 8th graders zoned to attend LHS are also eligible to join the band. Generally previous year 8th grade marchers join their classmates at new marcher events their freshman year.",,
,,,
Calendar and Schedule Info,,,
"When is ""marching season""?","Marching season starts with band camp in mid-July and ends with the Kentucky Music Educators Association (KMEA) State Championship, which is held each year at the end of October. In addition, the Lafayette Band marches in the Lexington Holiday Parade in December.",The kids also march in Lexington's annual Christmas parade.,
"Where can I see a schedule of all rehearsals, performances, competitions, camps, etc.?","The band website (www.lafayetteband.org) hosts a calendar that can be synced with your phone, and a detailed breakdown of the current week's schedule is emailed in the e-News every Sunday evening. Reminders and notes are often shared via Remind and on the LBA Facebook page (see more in ""Getting Connected"", below!).",,
Do all band sections have the same schedules?,"No! The different sections have a range of overlapping and individual rehearsals. During marching season these generally occur after school from about 3pm until ~6:30pm. This is in addition to ""camps"" (all day rehearsals) during school breaks. The Color Guard and Percussion section often have separate rehearsals, and each instrumental section has rehearsal with other instrumentalists and their own sections. Contact your section leader and/or see the band calendar at www.lafayetteband.org for more details!",,
Do students have to attend all scheduled practices? ... competitions and/or performances?,"Yes! It is critical that every student attend every rehearsal and competition! Mr. Bishop can approve requests for absences, but generally only does so for illness or family emergencies. If you have concerns or questions, please contact Mr. Bishop directly!",,
"What if I have a family vacation or commitment that conflicts with a mini-camp, band camp, fall break rehearsals, competitions or performances?","It is not advised to plan a vacation during marching season.  If you have a conflict, please contact Mr. Bishop immediately.  ",,
What happens if it rains on a rehearsal/competition day?,"Occasionally during practice and warm-ups the band may move inside the building to practice if it is raining, but we DO march (and certainly compete!) in the rain.  On competition days, the uniform crew will provide ponchos for the kids.  While the band staff and volunteers do everything possible to protect instruments, please be advised that your instrument may get wet, and will suffer bumps and bruises during marching season.  Typically, if you own a nicer instrument, such as a wood clarinet, you should also have a plastic instrument for marching season.",,
,,,
Rehearsals/Band Camp,,,
When are rehearsals? Is there band practice on the first day of school?,"Check the calendar on the website (www.lafayetteband.org) for up-to-date information. During marching season, rehearsals are typically everyday after school from 3:45 until ~6:15pm. There are ""camp"" or ""mini-camp"" rehearsals all day (generally 8 am to 5 pm) the three weeks before school starts, during Fall break, and a few times during the spring. Students should plan to arrive at least 15 minutes before rehearsal starts. While there is practice every school day, Mr. Bishop does not hold practice the first day of school.",,
When are camps/mini-camps?,"Check the calendar available at www.lafayetteband.org.  They start in April before the upcoming school year. Band Camp happens the last three weeks of summer break. Fall Camp happens during fall break. All ""camps"" are day camps held at LHS.",,
What happens at a typical rehearsal?,"Rehearsals start with a warmup routine that students learn at mini camps in the Spring. Warmups include a light jog, stretches, cardio, body (dance-like movements used to add effect while marching), and marching warmup routines. After warmups, sections typically split up (usually split between brass, woodwinds, and percussion) to work on either music, choreography, or drill (marching steps and patterns). Sections go through rotations and work with different directors throughout rehearsal. Towards the end of rehearsal, the whole band will come together and work on drill. This usually includes working on different sets (small segments of the show) and doing a full run of what is completed at the end of rehearsal. Parents and families are encouraged to arrive for pick-up early and watch these run-throughs at the end of rehearsal--it's a great opportunity to meet other parents, get a sense of the work the students do, and show our pride and appreciation of their efforts!... It's also cool to see/hear the show up close as they polish it!",,
What do we do about freshman orientation--it conflicts with band camp?,"Typically, once the school sets the orientation schedules Mr. Bishop will identify a specific orientation for band students to attend. If all band students attend this orientation it minimizes disruption to rehearsals. Please watch the the calendar on the band webpage at www.lafayetteband.org, or announcements through Remind or on the LBA Facebook Page for more details.","Last year there was a particular orientation band students were asked to attend... is that not the case again this year? probably but havent heard yet.  Yes, that will be the case","Freshman are encouraged to attend freshman orientation, even if it interferes with band camp. Orientation runs for several days, but students only attend one day. Orienation runs in the morning, so a student would only miss the morning portion of camp. Students will work with their section leaders to learn what they might've missed."
What do they learn at camps/mini-camps?,"At Spring mini-camps, students learn the body (sets of dance-like movements added to marching to enhance the visual effect of the show) and cardio warmups that are used at every rehearsal during the marching season. At Summer Band Camp, students learn marching fundamentals (how to achieve consistent steps and appearance while marching, how to march in various directions, make turns, and vary step size, all as part of a coherent group), show music, drill (the patterns of marching that form shapes on the field), and choreography (the body movements that enhance visual effect). The 1st movement (see above, ""What is a movement?"") of the show is the main focus, as the band will perform it at the Parent Performance on the last day of camp. At Fall Camp, the band focuses on learning the 3rd movement/last parts of the show. ",,
When do students learn/practice the music? Does all music have to be memorized?,Students will learn music at camps and during band class. Students work with band directors and section leaders to learn and rehearse music. All music for the show must be memorized.,,
What do students learn later in the season?... Haven't they already learned the show?,"Students will learn music for the whole show earlier in the season. However, drill for the show is constructed until the beginning of October. We will not learn the whole show at band camp, as Mr. Bishop prefers to work on each movement individually for several weeks. The whole show is typically completed during fall band camp. ",,
What should students bring to rehearsals?,"Students should bring their instrument, music, a towel (beach towel size), sunscreen, waterjug, and comfortable shoes and clothing. We work outside on the parking lot usually, so towels are used for comfort (e.g., to sit on) during warmups. Rehearsals are physical, and it can be quite hot, so all students should wear deoderant. A hat that shades the face and neck can also be useful. Sunscreen should be applied before arrival, and reapplied throughout the day. Students with medical needs or concerns must contact Mr. Bishop and the Chaperones before summer band camp.",,
What happens if it rains?,"It depends on the severity of the rain. If there is light rain with no thunder or lightning, students continue to work outside. It is advised to check the weather before rehearsal to decide whether to bring a raincoat or poncho. If there is lightning, thunder, and heavy rain, students will work inside, usually in the cafeteria or band room. As noted elsewhere, while every effort is made to protect instruments, that can get wet and/or suffer bumps and bruises, so it is highly recommended to march with a less expensive instrument.",,
When should students arrive for rehearsals? When should students be picked up?,"At least 15 minutes before the scheduled start time, as students need to be ready to go at the scheduled time. Check the calendar for rehearsal start times. Summer band camp usually begins at 8am, and ends at 5pm. School day rehearsals start at 3:45pm and usually go until 6:15pm. It is advised to arrive at least 15 minutes before rehearsal starts. It is important to note that if a rehearsal ends at a certain time, that is when students stop rehearsing; NOT when students will be leaving. Mr. Bishop, drum majors, section leaders, etc., typically give important announcements at the end of each rehearsal that take about 5-10 minutes, and students must gather their things and head to the senior lot. We encourage all parents and guardians to arrive early for pick-up and walk over to the band lot (practice area) to see and hear the days final run-through and to meet other parents and families!",,
Where do students rehearse? Where should students park/be dropped off/picked up?,"Students mainly rehearse in the band parking lot. This lot is on the back side of the school (near the Band room entrance) closest to the footbal stadium. It has two entrances on either side of the XXXX building. These entrances will be blocked off during band practice, and no cars may drive on or through the band lot before, during, or after practice. Students should be dropped off and picked up in the senior parking lot, located right next to the band lot. This is to ensure the kids' safety. The Senior lot has one entrance just before the softball field. After school hours students and parents/guardians can park in the senior lot. In fact, we encourage parents and guardians to arrive early for pick-up, leave your car in the senior lot, and come over to the band lot to see and hear the final run-through of the day. It's a great way to see the work students are putting in up close, and to meet other parents and families!",,
What is spunity?,"Spunity is a combined word of spirit and unity. Spunity is spirit week that happens the second and third week of band camp. Each section decides on themes for each day of the week, and students will dress up as that theme. Spunity is a fun way for sections to bond and work together, as it is a competition. The section that shows the most spirit, unity, sportsmanship, energy, and pride will be awarded the Spunity Stick, a long standing tradition of the Lafayette Band, at the end of band camp.  ",,
Can parents/families stay and watch rehearsals?,"Generally, yes! In fact we encourage parents and guardians to arrive early for pick-up, park in the senior lot, and walk over to the band lot to see and hear the final run-through of the day! It's a great way to get a sense of the work the students are doing, and to meet other parents and families. NOTE: we do request that no video or audio recordings of band rehearsals are taken. With 22 state championships, and a nationally competitive band program, other bands are constantly angling to see and hear ""what Lafayette is doing"". We want them to see and hear us... at competitions and other public performances when we are ready!",,
What is fall band camp?,"Fall band camp happens during fall break, usually on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday of break. Students rehearse from morning until the evening. Students typically focus on learning drill (the marching patterns and body movements) for the third movement and cleaning up the entire show. ",,
Band Performances/Competitions,,,
When does the marching band perform? When do the concert bands perform?,"The first ""perfomance"" by the marching band each year is the Parent Performance at the end of Band Camp. This informal performance in the LHS stadium shows off the progress made towards learning the show at Band Camp. The marching band performs at every Home football game during halftime. Through September and October the band performs at ~3-4 band competitions which are held in surrounding counties on Saturdays. The band performs at the Lafayette Invitational on a Saturday in mid-September (at LHS). The band closes the marching season by performing at the KMEA State Championship in late October, and marches in the Lexington Holiday Parade. Concert bands and instrumental chamber groups perform a number of concerts in the winter and spring.",,
Does the marching band perform at every football game?,The marching band performs at halftime at every HOME football game. We do not travel to away games.,,
What is the typical schedule for a band student on a football game day?,"Students are generally required to report to the band room to prepare for a football game sometime between 4 pm and 5 pm (depending on the exact start time of the game). Students should eat between the end of school and this report time, if at all possible. There is generally a brief rehearsal in the band lot, and then the students march as a block to the stadium. They are in place in a reserved section at the north end of the home stands at least 30 minutes prior to the game, and perform the National Anthem approximately 10 minutes before the game begins. Students remain in the stands during the first half, making their way to the sideline as the first half ends. They perform one or more movements of the show on the field, then return to their section in the stands. If there is a competition the next day, students are sometimes released before the end of the game. Students walk back to the band room to change out of their uniforms, and filter out of the band room door to leave. On Football Fridays, once the band marches to the stadium, the band lot is opened for spectator parking. As with all band performances, a detailed schedule is provided to the students listing all necessary report times.",,
Do parents/families attend football games? Do they have to buy tickets? What's a typical schedule for attendees?,"Parents and familes are strongly encouraged to attend football games!! We sit all over the stadium, but often congregate near the band section (north end of the home stands) or near the 50 yard line, often 1/2 to 2/3rds of the way up (for a good view!). Definitely bring you flags, and wear your band pins and Lafayette gear! Parents and family members do have to buy tickets, which are available at the gate. Tickets are $$$, and they accept both cash and credit card, though cash can be faster. The band marches as a block from the band lot (where they rehearse briefly before the game) along the side walk south of the baseball field. They enter through the gate on the northwest corner, and enter the stands on the ramp at the north end of the stadium. Parents and families may NOT sit with the band or in the band section. It is recommended that parents and families enter the stadium using the center ramp. The Lafayette students stand at the front of the stands just to the north of the 50 yard line in front of the cheerleaders. Many parents and families gather to see the band finish rehearsing and line the sidewalk they march along on the way to the stadium. To see the band march to the stadium families should plan to arrive AT LEAST 30 minutes (generally 60 minutes) before the scheduled game start time. Families should park in the senior lot, as the band lot will still be closed for rehearsal. Often families will leave the stands to walk with their band student from the stadium back to the school whenever the band is released. Depending on your student, it can take as few as 10 minutes to change out of the uniform and be ready to head home. There is general concession food available in the stadium at the south end of the home stands, though it is possible to bring outside food into the stadium. A fun option is to arrive early to watch rehearsal, bringing food to picnic along the outside of the band lot. Football games are quite short, with only 12 minute quarters, and a 20 minute half time. If the score is not competitive, the clock runs continuously. A typical first half can be as short as 30 minutes, ranging up to ~45 minutes. Plan accordingly if you aim to attend only for the half-time performance. See additional notes on what to bring to the stadium in ""What to bring to band performances/competitions"".",,
"What is the ""Lafayette Invitational""? Does the band perform at the Invitational?","The Lafayette Invitational is a marching band competition run by the Lafayette Band and hosted in the Lafayette Stadium. This is an extensive all-day event which raises a substantial amount of money for the band. Students and parents sign up for different jobs and shifts throughout the day to help the event run smoothly. Lafayette Band performs in exhibition after all bands have competed in finals. Exhibition means the band in not judged, but does perform.",,
"What is/When is... ""BOA""? ""Indy""? ""Johnson City""? ""State""?","BOA is an acronym for Bands of America. BOA is an organization that runs large marching band competitions nationwide, at different levels. These levels include regional, super regional, and grand national competitions. Lafayette Band usually partakes in one of these competitions in mid October. In the past, Lafayette Band has attended BOA competitions in Indianapolis, IN and Johnson City, TN. The Kentucky Music Educators Association (KMEA) State Marching Band Championship is not affiliated with BOA. The state competition is the largest competition for marching bands in Kentucky. Students compete with other bands in their class for the coveted state title--of which Lafayette has won 22--by far the most of any school. ""State"" occurs at the end of the marching season in late October and is held at a Kentucky university.",,
"What are ""prelims"" and ""finals""?","Prelims are the first (preliminary) round of performances at a competition. Bands are judged within their class and scored accordingly. The prelims score determines the bands placement in finals competition, during which finalist bands perform a second time. The top scoring bands from prelims, regardless of class of competition, advance to the finals round. Scores from a band's finals performance (the second of the day) determine the Grand Champion (overall competition winner). The KMEA State Championship differs in that there are separate finals competitions for each class.",,
"Are band competitions really ""competitions""? How are bands scored?","Yes! Anywhere between 10 and 20 (or more) bands will gather for a competition. They are intially grouped based on a combination of the size of the band (number of student performers) and size of their school (9-12th grade enrollment). Lafayette is one of the largest bands in the state, and is consistently the largest high school (by 9-12th grade enrollment) in the state, and competes in the top class, called 5A (the smallest class is called 1A). All bands perform once in a preliminary round (""prelims""), and are judged by at least six judges, three on or near the field, and three in the press box. Bands are scored on musical performance as an ensemble and as individuals, on visual performance as an ensemble and individuals, and on the general (overall) effect of the music and visuals. Within each of these categories are sub-scores. All scores are combined and weighted according to a set formula, and the band receive an overall score. Separately the Color Guard and Drum Line may be scored as well. The bands in each class are ranked and win awards based on their rank in class. The top ~10 bands overall, regardless of class, are selected to perform again in a Final found (Finals). The finalist bands are scored again on their second performance, and ranked by overall score, with the top scoring band (in Finals) named ""Grand Champion"". During Finals awards for Best Music, Best Visual Effect, Best General Effect, Best Color Guard, and Best Drumline are also awarded based on the appropriate sub-scores. Among the most competitive bands, fractions of a point will generally differentiate finalist bands. Scores are made available to both the bands and the public after both preliminary and finals rounds. The website https://kyband.com is a good resource for current and past scores. Judges are experienced band directors and marching band professionals drawn from all over the country and are paid for their time. For extremely large competitions (like State) some competition classes hold prelims, semi-finals (semis), and finals. There are so few bands in Kentucky in Class 5A that there is no 5A preliminary round, and all 5A bands automatically qualify for the semi-finals. At regular competitions, the prelims generally occur beginning in the morning, and running into the early afternoon, with the finals following in the evening into the night. See details of competition schedules and timelines elsewhere. Note that there is a never a garauntee that a band will advance to the finals round, though the Lafayette Band aims to not only final, but win, every competition they enter.",,"Bands compete against other bands in their class division. Class is determined by both size of the band and size of the school. Lafayette Band is in the largest-size class division, called 5A. The smallest division is 1A. At KMEA sanctioned competitions, bands compete against others in their class at prelims, and then compete against all bands of all classes in finals. However, at the state marching band competition, bands are only competing against other bands in their class division for both semifinals and finals. Bands are scored by judges on the field and in the box at the top of the stadium. A competition usually consists of about six judges total. Different judges will score different aspects of a marching show, such as music performance, visual performance, and general effect. There are subcategories to each of these categories. Band competitons are very much considered competitions, as the bands are competing for first place and high scores in each category."
When are band competitions? How many does the band participate in?,"Band competitions happen on Saturdays and last all day, starting with an early morning rehearsal, and concluding with arrival back at Lafayette HS generally around midnight or later. The band usually attends three competitions, the Lafayette Invitational, the state marching band competition, and possibly a BOA event each year.",,
What is the typical schedule for band students on competition days?,"Students start the day with an early morning rehearsal at Lafayette, typically beginning at 7am. Students rehearse mid morning, and are then fed lunch by the food crew. Students are given time after lunch to fix hair before departing for the competition. Departure times depend on the band's assigned preliminary round performance time, which is generally know a week or so before the competition. Typically these times are around around noon. Once arrived at the competition, the band will dress and warmup before prelims performance. After prelims performance the band attends the preliminary awards ceremony, at which the best bands in each class are recognized. After this, assuming the band makes the finals, students change out of their uniforms and are fed dinner before having mandatory rest time. Mandatory rest lasts about an hour, and students are given time to rest and take a quick nap. After mandatory rest, students get dressed again before having rehearsal and warmups. The band competes in finals competition at a time determined by a draw following the prelim round, typically in the late evening. The day concludes with finals awards, where awards are given for overall best visuals, general effect, music, percussion, colorguard, and overall placements. The Grand Champion band is generally invited to remain on the field after Finals awards to offer an encore performance (the third of the day, generally occuring ~10-11pm). After awards or an encore performance, students change out of uniforms and load buses to head back to Lafayette HS.  Note that students must remain with the band for the entirety of the day, and must travel both to and from the competition on the band buses.",,
How do students get to/from competitions/performances? Can parents/families ride with band students?,"The band is transported via buses to competitions. The band usually takes six buses to competition. Bus placements are assigned by signups, where students can request a bus. Parents are not permitted to ride with band students on the bus. Several chaperones are assigned to each bus to supervise the kids. ",,
Do parents/families/friends attend band competitions? How do they get there?,"Yes, parents, families, and friends attend band competitions! You are STRONGLY encouraged to do so to support the band and share the experience with other band families! Competition attendees must provide their own transportation unless they are a member of a band crew directly supporting the band on the competition day.",,
"If I attend a competition, what should I expect? What schedule should I plan? What should I bring?","Expect to be impressed, a bit overwhelmed, and to have a great time! The schedule for attendees is somewhat variable, based on (1) where the competition is, and details of how the competition site is arranged, (2) when the band is scheduled to perform in prelims, and if you intend to see the prelim performance, (3) if the band make finals, what finals time they draw, and if you intend to see this performance, and (4) if they are named Grand Champion and perform an encore, if you intend to see this performance! Typical competitions that the band participates in (e.g. Bourbon County, or George Rogers Clark) are about 45 mins - 1 hour away from Lexington. Parking is either on-site (Bourbon County) or at one of a number of remote sites (GRC). In either case it will take some time to park and walk (ride shuttles) to the stadium--typically 30 minutes, plus or minus, depending on site details. Once at the stadium you will need to buy tickets, and may buy a program. You should bring both cash and a credit card, including enough cash to buy food at the concession stand, if desired. There are often small art fairs, competition t-shirt booths, bake sales, or other vendors at competition sites. Generally parking is free, but may be on a grass field. Entry tickets are typically ~$10 per person. Once inside the stadium you will want to find seats--something that can be challenging depending on when you arrive and the size of the stands (Bourbon County: small; GRC: larger). Only the home stands are used. It is STRONGLY recommended that you bring a seat cushion or seat cushion with back, as you may be seated for an extended period of time in cramped and crowded stands. Generally you may only move around in or into/out of the stands between band performances, so be sure to arrive enough ahead of Lafayette's performance so you can move into place a least a band or two early. THAT SAID, you are STRONGLY encouraged to arrive MULTIPLE Bands ahead of Lafayette, both to ensure you get seats, and so that you can get a sense of what other bands are doing. Each band has a 15 minute window in which to perform, so you will be able to see 4 bands per hour. With up to 20 (or possibly more) bands performing in prelims at each competition, the prelim round in total can easily last more than 5 hours, as every 4-6 bands there is often a 15 minute break. Please come prepared for all weather:  wear a hat and sunscreen (this is essential!), bring ponchos (umbrellas are generally discouraged). You can package some hand towels in ziploc bags to use to dry off seats, etc, in case of rain. Towards the end of the season wear MANY LAYERS, gloves, hats, scarves, blankets, etc., and bring hand warmers--it is windy, exposed, and cold in the stands. Early in the season bring lots of water, a personal fan, and sunglasses--in the evenings as the sun sets it will often be in your eyes, and early in the season it is HOT and shadeless in the stands!

Though only 10-12 bands make the finals, attendees from all the finalist bands generally attend the entire finals. Because of this, the stands are often most crowded during finals. Particularly at smaller stadiums, arriving during finals may mean that you are unable to find a seat. A twelve band final will usually last 3.5 hours (3 hours of performing plus two 15 minute breaks. Finals often start around 6 pm. There is a delay after the final finalist performs, during which the host high school band usually performs ""in exhibition"". The finalist bands then arrange themselves on the field, and awards start, often around 10 pm. The Grand Champion (top finals band) generally remains on the field after awards, warms up, and performs their show again as an encore, starting, typically between 10:30 and 11pm.Band competitions generally last the entire day.
